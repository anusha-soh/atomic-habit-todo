## Prompt

Write a comprehensive specification for Phase 2 Chunk 3: Habits MVP. This is Chunk 3 of 7-chunk Phase 2 delivery plan. Build habit management system with Atomic Habits Four Laws integration: Identity statement, 2-minute version, habit stacking cue, motivation, category, and recurring schedule.

## Response snapshot

- Created branch `003-habits-mvp`.
- Generated `specs/003-habits-mvp/spec.md` with identity-driven user stories and Atomic Habits mapping.
- Established functional requirements for CRUD operations, habit stacking, and the 2-minute rule.
- Created and validated a quality checklist at `specs/003-habits-mvp/checklists/requirements.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. Core habit CRUD functionality specified according to constitution principles.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: `specs/003-habits-mvp/spec.md`, `specs/003-habits-mvp/checklists/requirements.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create the technical implementation plan for Chunk 3.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully corrected course after initially targeting Chunk 7. The specification now aligns with the Phase 2 roadmap.
