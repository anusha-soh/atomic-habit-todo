# Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Constitution Alignment | CRITICAL | plan.md | All constitution principles pass | Continue with implementation |
| A1 | Duplication | LOW | spec.md | Some similar acceptance criteria across user stories | Acceptable for different user stories |
| B1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | spec.md | Some requirements use terms like "fast" without specific metrics | Metrics provided in Success Criteria section |

## Coverage Summary Table:

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| user-can-create-tasks | Yes | T025, T027 | Implemented |
| user-can-view-tasks | Yes | T026, T028 | Implemented |
| user-can-update-tasks | Yes | T045, T047 | Pending implementation |
| user-can-delete-tasks | Yes | T060, T061 | Pending implementation |
| user-can-filter-tasks | Yes | T102, T127 | Pending implementation |
| user-can-search-tasks | Yes | T115, T116 | Pending implementation |

## Constitution Alignment Issues: None

## Unmapped Tasks: None

## Metrics:

- Total Requirements: 30
- Total Tasks: 165
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 100%
- Ambiguity Count: 1
- Duplication Count: 1
- Critical Issues Count: 0

## Next Actions

- No CRITICAL issues exist, implementation can proceed
- Current implementation appears to be progressing well according to tasks.md
- Many tasks are marked as completed in the tasks file

## Overall Assessment

The specification, plan, and tasks are well-aligned and comprehensive. The implementation appears to be progressing according to the defined tasks. Most foundational work (phases 1-2) appears to be complete based on the checked boxes in tasks.md.
